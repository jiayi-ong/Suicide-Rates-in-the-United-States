### Abstract
We study how suicide rates in the United States
respond to economic determinants such as
unemployment rates and median salary, and
how selected determinants evolve dynamically
with diseases related to COVID-19. Our project
is inspired by threats of an imminent recession
and our concern regarding its secondary health
outcomes. We seek to investigate a potential
need for investment in preventative measures
by governments such as mental health support,
counselling, and greater individual support for
those in the labor force. We aim to avoid a
complete shift of governmental focus away from
health issues once the pandemic subsides, as
there are risks associated with the economic
downturn that will surely follow. We extract
data from a wide range of online government
databases to conduct multi-variate analysis using
a random effects logistic model and a vector
auto-regressive model. We show that unemployment
and salary have significantly positive and
negative time-invariant impacts on suicide rate,
respectively. We also estimate that the effect
of an exogenous shock from pneumonia deaths
on insured unemployment rate lasts beyond 52
weeks. Policy implications of our findings are
discussed, along with our proposals for effective
policies to prevent a critical rise in suicide rates.
